      The first dataset consists of the number of suicides each year in a given country, split by sex and age groups, plus the total population in according group,
      thus allowing us to calculate the crude rates per 100k people. The use of rates seems obvious, as the sheer number of suicides corresponds to the size of the population:
      the bigger the country, the more suicides.
